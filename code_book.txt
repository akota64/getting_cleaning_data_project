Experiment and Pre-Analysis Overview: 
- 30 subjects, each numbered 1-30, are tasked to perform 6 different activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II on their waists: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs.
- Measurements of linear acceleration and angular velocity were taken at a constant 50 Hz in all three dimensions.
- The measurements were analyzed in 2.56 s windows, with 50% overlap between windows. For each window, pre-processing was performed to obtain window mean, window standard deviation, etc.. These are the measurements recorded in the observational data set (X).
- Measurements were taken in the time domain, but then processed also into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform.
- NOTE: Each row in X corresponds to 1 pre-processed window of measurement, not a single measurement.

Analysis Overview:
- The observational data set was labeled with the correct subject and activity performed for each window (row).
- Only the mean and st.dev. for each variable was taken for each window (row). All other columns were discarded.
- All windows were averaged over, grouped by subject+activity combo, to obtain the final tidy data set. Thus, there is only 1 entry for subject 17 walking, for example, in the tidy data set. This row contains the average mean and average st.dev. across windows for any given variable measured.


The first 2 variables in the tidy data set, UCI_HAR_tidy_data.txt, are described below:

"subject" (int): The number of the subject performing the activity
"activity" (string): The activity performed by the subject in the "subject" column. Each subject performed a total of 6 activities and sets of measurements were taken during each activity.



The rest of the variables in the tidy data set are listed below. The terminology involved in each variable is explained after the variable list.

Explanation of terminology:
"average": Averaged across all pertinent windows (grouped by subject and activity in the outputted tidy data set)
"time_domain": For measurements taken in the time domain
"frequency_domain": For measurements taken in the frequency domain
"body_acc": Acceleration of the body, subtracting acceleration from gravity
"gravity_acc": Acceleration from gravity
"body_gyro": Angular velocity of the body
"jerk": Change in ... over time, i.e. body_acc_jerk is the change in body's linear acceleration over time
"mag": Magnitude in 3 dimensions, i.e. body_acc_mag is the magnitude of the 3-dimensional body_acc vector
"mean": Mean of the variable over a single window
"std": Standard deviation of the variable over a single window
"x","y","z": The x, y, z coordinates of the variable's vector. Variables with "mag" will not have these, because a "mag" variable is the magnitude of a vector, not a vector.
"_": Used as a separator to separate different 'words' in the variable names
